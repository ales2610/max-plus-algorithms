# max-plus-algorithms

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of two alogithms in max-plus algebra. One is Howard's algorithm for calculating generalised eigenmode of heigher order recurance relation x(k) = A_0 * x(k) + ... + A_m * x(k-m), where * is max-plus matrix multiplication and + is maximum. The second algorithm is LEA (Lyapunov exponent algorithm) for finding the stochastic equivalent of eigenvalue of a sequance of a.s. irreducible random matrices A(k). One function is made for systems of order one, and the second for order two (that just naively translates the second order recirsive equation to the first order one).
