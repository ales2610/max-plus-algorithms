This repository contains MATLAB implementations of Howard's algorithm for calculating generalised eigenmode of heigher order recurance relation x(k) = A_0 * x(k) + ... + A_m * x(k-m) and implementation of LEA (Lyapunov exponent algorithm) for finding the stochastic equivalent of eigenvalue of a sequance of a.s. irreducible random matrices A(k). One function is made for systems of order one, and the second for order two (that just naively translates the second order recirsive equation to the first order one).
